## Writing a Bachelor/Master Thesis at the Data Engineering Systems Group

This is the template for a thesis at our group.
It is a very basic template that tries not to restrict you but lets you focus on writing.

### How to Use the Template
The template consists of the main `thesis.tex` file, a folder for the individual sections, and a folder for the images that you use.

In the `thesis.tex` file, you can set a few variables at the beginning of the file that then fill your cover page.

The template is also available as a [template in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/hpides-thesis-template/kjqgzvcsdtsy). 
You can open it there and start working directly without installing Latex on your machine.
You can always find the newest version of this template in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hpides/thesis-template).
